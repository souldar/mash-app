See [docs/module-structure.md](docs/module-structure.md) for module ownership and placement rules.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (stable)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [ADB](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) (must be on PATH)
- Python 3 + [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (only needed to build the sidecar)

## Development

In-progress friend-point inventory maintenance work: [cross-machine handoff and remaining tasks](docs/development/friend-point-inventory-maintenance-handoff.md).

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
pnpm install

# Start dev mode (Vite + Rust hot reload)
pnpm tauri dev

# Frontend-only dev server (no Tauri shell)
pnpm dev

# Lint
pnpm lint
```

### CV Runtime

The automation runtime depends on the `mash-cv` sidecar for screen recognition and the scrcpy H.264 stream. `mash-cv` is **not** bundled into the Tauri app. The main app ships only the UI/Rust/resources bundle and reads `src-tauri/resources/runtime-manifest.json` to decide which external CV packages are required.

```text
app_data_dir()/runtime/mash-cv/runtime/<runtimeVersion>/mash-cv-runtime/
app_data_dir()/runtime/mash-cv/code/<codeVersion>/mash-cv-code/
```

The runtime base contains the heavy PyInstaller/native dependency tree and OCR models. The code package contains the lightweight `mash_cv/*.py` source. If either artifact is missing or stale, the app shows a CV package install button near the automation entry points.

Version numbers are managed in `versions.toml` and use `x.x.x` format. Distribution details, R2 object layout, tag conventions, and release troubleshooting are documented in [docs/distribution.md](docs/distribution.md).

Build local sidecar artifacts for testing:

```bash
cd sidecar/mash_cv
bash build_sidecar.sh
```

Release entry points:

```bash
# App updater release: bump versions, commit, and tag vX.Y.Z
scripts/bump-app-version.sh 0.2.2

# CV code release: push tag, GitHub Actions uploads to R2
scripts/bump-cv-code-version.sh 0.2.2
git tag cv-code/0.2.2
git push origin cv-code/0.2.2

# CV code release from the local machine
R2_ENDPOINT=... R2_BUCKET=... RELEASE_BASE_URL=... scripts/release-cv-code.sh 0.2.2

# CV runtime release: build, upload to R2, update manifest, commit, and tag
R2_ENDPOINT=... R2_BUCKET=... RELEASE_BASE_URL=... scripts/release-cv-runtime.sh 0.2.2
```

Running the sidecar as PyInstaller `--onedir` avoids re-extracting dylibs on every launch, cutting warm-start time to well under a second after the runtime is installed.

Run the sidecar tests (no Rust/Node required):

```bash
cd sidecar/mash_cv
poetry install
poetry run pytest
```

## Production Build

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

The Tauri bundle intentionally excludes `mash-cv`; app updates remain small. Bump `mashCvCodeVersion` for Python-only sidecar changes. Bump `mashCvRuntimeVersion` only when OCR models, PyInstaller dependencies, native dependencies, or the runtime launcher/archive layout changes. See [docs/distribution.md](docs/distribution.md) for the release flow.

## How It Works

1. Connects to an Android device or BlueStacks emulator via ADB
2. The `mash-cv` sidecar pushes `scrcpy-server.jar` to the device and opens a realtime H.264 stream, decoding frames with PyAV
3. The Rust runner drives a state machine that asks the sidecar to identify the current screen (team confirm, support select, battle, …) and find UI elements via config-driven OpenCV template matching
4. Support selection OCR uses servant metadata localized for the active server. For CN, `name_cn_server` in `servants.json` is preferred over `name_cn` when present, so renamed in-game servant/NP text is matched first.
5. During battle, the sidecar also OCRs the turn number (anchor-bounded digit template matching) so the runner can schedule skills turn-by-turn
6. Based on the detected screen, the runner issues tap/swipe commands over ADB
7. The frontend displays real-time automation status and allows stopping at any time
