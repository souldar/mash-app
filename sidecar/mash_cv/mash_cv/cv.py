mash-cv: OpenCV-based screen detection sidecar for mash.

Long-running process. Reads JSON commands from stdin (one per line),
writes JSON responses to stdout (one per line). Every request may carry an
``id`` field; if present, the response echoes the same ``id`` so the caller
can ignore stale responses left over from a previously timed-out request.

# taking the per-anchor max as the row's score. Adding a new
# variant is "drop a PNG in templates/ and append the stem here";

    collapsed by y-NMS (``SUPPORT_SCORE_NMS_DY``).

    Pure grayscale Canny is unreliable here: the "X分钟前" /
    "友情点 +25" labels nearby produce stronger edges and overlap the
    score badge in the strip, while the badge's own outline is too low

      Compare against ``SUPPORT_GRAND_BADGE_MATCH_THRESHOLD`` to

# artwork search drives ``cv2.matchTemplate`` against bright outliers that
# don't exist in ``card_ce.png`` and the correlation collapses to ~0.05
# even when the asset and the on-screen thumbnail come from the same

# search when bond / bondNp mode is active. Some Grand-link rows already

# threshold can flip with sub-pixel rendering jitter even when the right
# CE is on screen. Relax the artwork threshold to 0.65 only for bond
